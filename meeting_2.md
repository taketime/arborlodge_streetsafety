# Arbor Lodge Street Safety Committee. Meeting 2!
-------

## last time
* came up with ideas, and prioritize them
* priority 1 was the silent ride. Happened Wednesday, great attendance.
* priority 2: infrastructure improvements for Rosa Parks and Delaware
* priority 3: education events with Sunday Parkways

## Infrastructure improvements for Rosa Parks and Delaware
* consider ways we can improve safety
* encourage safer driving by design
	* <blockquote>"A person is 25 times more likely to be killed on a Portland road posted at 35 MPH or higher compared to a road posted at 25 MPH or slower" [PBOT 2015 safety report](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/563991)</blockquote>

* encourage safer driving by increased enforcement
* gathering data on what's really happening at Rosa Parks and Delaware
	* the city does not have [traffic counts at Rosa Parks and Delaware](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7ce8d1f5053141f1bc0f5bd7905351e6)
	* the city has posted a speed limit of 35, but how fast are people really driving?
	* volunteer shifts for count cars and speeds around school let out time, commute time
	* what other data may the city be missing?

## Potential partners
* what stories are best for recruiting additional supporters?
   * 2015: 10 people died walking; 2 died biking
   * 2016: 5 people have died walking; 2 died biking. It's only May. Loads of injured. All ages. [Source](https://gist.github.com/taketime/c7a7d4897577bb2626be18901e9b039c)
* [Shamus Lynsky and Shayna Rehberg](http://bikeportland.org/2011/09/01/a-ride-along-on-the-newly-completed-rosa-parks-bikeway-project-58449) are credited with improving Rosa Parks between Montana and Vancouver in a September 2011 bikeportland post. Does anyone know them?
* PBOT
* Chief Joseph PTA. After the Wednesday meeting, (Mike?) Potter told me the PTA is excited to talk about safety at this intersection, and that some of those driving unsafely. He and other parents notice unsafe driving, both in other folks and in other parents. They want to do something, and would be great partners.
* Police
* others?

## Finally
* I just discovered [Hanne's Blog](https://hanbriwav.blogspot.com/). It's a powerful reminder of what needs fixing.
